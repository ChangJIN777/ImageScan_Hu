    %In order to communicate with the pulseblaster, I had to make my own
    %format for Matlab to follow. Thus, programs are saved as an Nx5
    %matrix, where each column has the following meaning:
    %
        %Column 1: The line number for the code. The pulse blaster starts
        %at 0, so I mimicked this. This is just to make sure that the
        %pulseblaster and the user's code are in agreement.
        %
        %Column 2: The value sent to the pulseblaster indicating which bits
        %to turn on, in decimal. The pulseblaster refuses to keep any bits
        %on for longer than 5 clock cycles unless the last 3 bits (hex E00000)
        %are on, hence the large numbers.
        %
        %Column 3: The code corresponding to the desired command. These are
        %listed in the user manual for the Pulseblaster on page 21.
        %
        %Column 4: This is data specific to the instruction. Information on
        %this can be found in the user manual for the Pulseblaster on page
        %21.
        %
        %Column 5: The number of clockcycles per command. As far as I can tell, the
        %pulseblaster waits this long after issuing every command, so this 
        %is ignored for stop and wait commands.

                %The general idea for this program is that it checks if a
                %certain number of lines are equal to the next block of the
                %exact same size. By starting with the largest reasonable
                %number (a third of the total length) and decreasing the
                %number of lines every time, it can find loops as
                %efficiently as possible. If a loop is found, the program
                %stops and just re-calls itself recursively to avoid errors
                %caused by changing the size of the matrix.
                %
                %Unfortunately, this does not always result in the smallest
                %loops possible, which means there are more lines of code
                %being passed to the pulseblaster. To fix this, every time
                %a loop is discovered, the program checks if shrinking the
                %original code by the new loop instead of any older ones
                %would condense it more.
                %
                %As an example, repeating a 5-line loop 100 times would
                %make code that is 500 lines long. If we just condensed it
                %from the largest loop size possible, the first found loop
                %would be 130 lines long, with 10 left over at the end. The
                %next iteration finds a loop 45 lines long, then one 15
                %lines long, then stops, leaving code that is around 30~40
                %lines total. If it instead tried to compress by the 15
                %line loop from the start, it would end up with only 20
                %lines of code, so this function attempts that every time a
                %loop is found to make the smallest code possible.
